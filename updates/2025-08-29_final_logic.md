# Final Application Logic & Bug Fixes - 2025-08-29 15:30

This document clarifies the final, correct application logic as specified and documents the last set of critical bug fixes.

## 1. Core Application Objective

This defines the expected behavior of the application.

### Text Mode
- A pure, text-only chat interface.
- The user sends a text message.
- The LLM generates a response.
- The AI's response appears as a text bubble in the chat UI.
- **No Text-to-Speech (TTS) is used in this mode.**

### Voice Mode
1.  The user clicks "Start Conversation".
2.  **Greeting:** The assistant immediately speaks a greeting ("Hi! I am your AI assistant...") using the high-quality Kokoro voice. The corresponding text bubble appears in the UI.
3.  **User Speaks:** The user talks in a hands-free manner.
4.  **VAD & Transcription:** The Kyutai STT/VAD engine listens, detects when the user has stopped speaking, and transcribes the audio.
5.  **UI Update:** The user's transcribed words appear in a chat bubble.
6.  **LLM Processing:** The transcript is sent to the LLM for a conversational response.
7.  **TTS Response:** The LLM's text response is sent to the Kokoro TTS engine to be synthesized into speech.
8.  **Final Output:** The AI's spoken response is played through the user's speakers, and the corresponding text bubble appears in the UI.
9.  The conversation continues until the user clicks "Stop Conversation".

## 2. Final Bug Fixes

-   **`SyntaxError` in `TTSAgent`:** A critical crash on startup was fixed. An incorrectly structured `try...except` block, caused by a previous faulty edit, was repaired.
-   **Text/Voice Logic:** The backend agents have been modified to differentiate between text-mode and voice-mode conversations. A `source` flag is now passed internally to ensure TTS is only triggered for voice-based interactions, as per the objective above.
