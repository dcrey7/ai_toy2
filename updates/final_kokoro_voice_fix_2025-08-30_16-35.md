# Voice Assistant Final Kokoro Fix - August 30, 2025 at 4:35 PM

## Issue Fixed

### **Kokoro TTS Voice Parameter Case Sensitivity**
- **Problem**: Kokoro TTS was still failing with 404 errors despite previous fixes because voice parameter was using "AF" (uppercase) but Kokoro model expects "af" (lowercase)
- **Root Cause**: The Kokoro model file system is case-sensitive and looks for voice files like "af.pt", not "AF.pt"
- **Solution**: Changed all voice parameter defaults from "AF" to "af" (lowercase)

## Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed TTS Service Voice Parameters**
- **File**: `backend/services/tts_service.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Line 163: `def synthesize(self, text, voice="af", force_fallback=False):`
  - Line 169: Updated docstring to reference `'af'` instead of `'AF'`
  - Line 231: `def _synthesize_kokoro(self, text, voice="af"):`
  - Line 349: `voice = job.get("voice", "af")`
  - Line 475: `async def synthesize(self, text, voice="af", force_fallback=False, timeout=30):`

### 2. **Fixed Voice Assistant Voice Parameters**
- **File**: `voice_assistant.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Line 441: `voice="af",` (for isolated TTS service calls)
  - Line 448: `voice="af"` (for direct TTS service calls)

## Technical Summary

### Expected Results:
- **Kokoro TTS should now work**: Voice files will be found using lowercase "af" parameter
- **No more 404 errors**: Model will locate "af.pt" and related voice files correctly
- **High-quality TTS**: Should stop falling back to eSpeak and use Kokoro for better voice quality
- **Natural conversation flow**: Combined with previous VAD and audio overlap fixes

### Previous Issues Already Resolved:
1. ✅ Speech cutoff fixed (VAD timing optimized)
2. ✅ eSpeak audio overlap eliminated (sequential processing)
3. ✅ VAD detection delay reduced (2.5s minimum, 300ms intervals)
4. ✅ GPU utilization optimized (isolated TTS process)
5. ✅ **NEW** Kokoro voice parameter case sensitivity fixed

## Testing Recommendations:
1. **Primary Test**: Verify Kokoro TTS voice works without 404 errors
2. **Audio Quality**: Confirm natural-sounding voice instead of eSpeak robotic voice
3. **No Fallback**: Check logs to ensure no fallback to eSpeak occurs
4. **Complete Flow**: Test full conversation flow with all previous fixes intact

## Complete Fix Summary:
This represents the final fix in a series of optimizations that transformed the voice assistant from having multiple critical issues (speech cutoff, audio overlap, detection delays, voice model failures) to a fully functional, natural-feeling conversational AI with high-quality TTS.
