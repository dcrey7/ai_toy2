# Voice Assistant Fixes - August 30, 2025 at 4:06 PM

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Speech Getting Cut Off During Conversation**
- **Problem**: VAD (Voice Activity Detection) was triggering too quickly with only 1.5 seconds of audio
- **Solution**: Increased minimum audio requirement to 3 seconds before VAD analysis
- **Changes Made**:
  - Changed minimum audio length from 1.5s to 3.0s in `smart_turn_vad.py:142-143`
  - Increased turn check interval from 200ms to 500ms to be less aggressive
  - Changed required consecutive detections from 1 to 2 for better stability

### 2. **VAD Sensitivity Issues**  
- **Problem**: VAD was too sensitive and completing turns prematurely
- **Solution**: Adjusted confidence thresholds and detection logic
- **Changes Made**:
  - Increased confidence threshold from 0.35 to 0.45
  - Removed the fallback high-confidence detection (0.7 threshold) that was causing premature completions
  - Increased silence timeout from 3s to 4s
  - Made detection more conservative by requiring exact "complete" label with proper confidence

### 3. **Isolated TTS Service Disabled**
- **Problem**: CUDA conflicts causing TTS isolation service to be disabled
- **Solution**: Re-enabled isolated TTS service with proper error handling
- **Changes Made**:
  - Replaced hard-coded disable with try/catch initialization in `voice_assistant.py:579-587`
  - Added fallback to direct TTS if isolated TTS fails to initialize
  - Removed TODO comments about temporary disable

### 4. **Message Handling/Transcription Fragmentation**
- **Problem**: Short speech fragments were being transcribed as incomplete phrases
- **Solution**: VAD improvements should result in more complete speech capture before transcription
- **Changes Made**:
  - VAD now waits longer before triggering transcription, allowing for more complete speech

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
1. `/backend/services/smart_turn_vad.py` - VAD sensitivity and timing adjustments
2. `/voice_assistant.py` - Re-enabled isolated TTS service

### Expected Results:
- Speech should no longer be cut off after 1.5 seconds
- More complete sentences should be transcribed instead of fragments
- Better CUDA memory management with isolated TTS service
- More stable voice conversation flow

## Testing Required:
- Test voice conversations to ensure speech isn't cut off mid-sentence
- Verify complete phrases are transcribed rather than fragments like "my name", "But"  
- Check that isolated TTS service initializes properly or falls back gracefully
